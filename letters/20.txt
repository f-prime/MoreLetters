Alsa,
<br/><br/><br/>

<p>
I am sure that you heard, but this leak has confirmed what we have all been<br/>
suspecting for a long time. They have been spying on us, reading our letters, and<br/>
violating our privacy. It isn't safe to send unencrypted letters anymore. I have joined<br/>
a group of people who are trying to do something about this.<br/><br/>
I hope that you will heed my advice. Do not send unencrypted letters anymore.<br/><br/>
It is not safe anymore. More Letters Inc. is not to be trusted.
</p>

<br/><br/><br/><br/>
Lars
