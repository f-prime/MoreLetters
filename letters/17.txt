Dear Alsa,
<br/><br/><br/>

<p>
The protests have been getting much more intense.<br/>
They were marching about a mile from my house and it turned into a riot.<br/>
The police had to intervene and everything. Apparently it was over some privacy violations. <br/>
According to these people, our phones and computers are being hacked and we are being spied on by Send Mail.<br/><br/>

I think they're pretty crazy, but I have been wondering how it's possible for this company to do
half the things it does.<br/><br/>

Something to think about I guess.
</p>

<br/><br/><br/><br/>
Best,<br/>
Lars
