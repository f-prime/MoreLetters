Over time you start to build up a resistance to failure. It no longer becomes
this scary shameful thing, but just another possible end to a winding journey. You
start to appreciate the process rather than the outcome because it is during the process
that the real growth happens. With every failure comes an opportunity to grow. Every bit of
growth gets you closer to your goals. Embrace failure and love the journey.
