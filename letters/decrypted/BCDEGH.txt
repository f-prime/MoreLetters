Halloween Once a year, the ghosts and ghouls come out Every year I dont understand what Halloween is about A chance to be different, maybe hide what you feel Being the something or someone, your identity is concealed But why is not every day Halloween? We dress up as ourselves but what does this mean The women look pretty, men acting manly Nothing makes sense lets just eat candy
