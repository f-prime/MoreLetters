Tis said 

The horse and mule live thirty years
And never knows of wines and beers
The goat and sheep at twenty die
Without a taste of scotch or rye
The cow drinks water by the ton
And at eighteen is mostly done
The dog at fifteen cashes in
Without the aid of rum or gin
The modest, sober, bone dry hen
Lays eggs for noggs and dies at ten
But sinful, ginful, rum-soaked men
Survive three score years and ten
And some of us, though mighty few
Stay pickled til we're ninety two
