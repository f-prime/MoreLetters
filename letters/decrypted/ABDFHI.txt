Worms I want to lie in a ditch and let the worms eat me I hope it rains so they can get to me quicker No clothes to have that protective layer between me and the worms Use the energy of my flesh and blood, a bountiful feast for my new family Convert me into little worm energy so you can have worm sex Depositing sperm into sacs forming cocoons on clitellums. My molecules and atoms live on. Eventually I become worms, Yay.
