I have always been vulnerable to ideas those little creatures that live out in the universe waiting for a suitable host the thing about ideas is that once they are inside you they never really leave the longer you try to ignore them the more eager they are to escape i guess some people find it easier to suppress these beasts more than others for me though i cant seem to suppress them at all they eat at me keep me up at night when i finally decide to let one out it consumes me i become obsessed satisfying it becomes the sole purpose of my existence and when it has had its fill of me its gone and i am here with this emptiness inside waiting to once again be filled by another one of these celestial parasites
