Could a machine ever be said to have made its own decisions
Could a machine have beliefs 
Could a machine make mistakes 
Could a machine believe it made its own decisions
Could a machine erroneously attribute free will to itself 
Could a machine come up with ideas that had not been programmed into it in advance 
Could creativity emerge from a set of fixed rules 
Are we even the most creative among us but passive slaves to the 
laws of physics that govern our neurons
