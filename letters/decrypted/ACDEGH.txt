The best news a person with cancer can hear is that he/she has gone into remission.
Better yet, in subsequent scans and tests there is still no sign of the cancer returning.
"You are cured" you're told.

The thing about cancer is that it never actually leaves you. 

For the rest of your life you are left with this nagging feeling in the back of your mind.
That "what-if" feeling. It never goes away. It feels like borrowed time. 
The occasional nightmares. Remembering the pain of the surgery. It never goes away.

I thought over the years I would start to forget about that time in my life. 
I feel like now I think about it more than ever.
