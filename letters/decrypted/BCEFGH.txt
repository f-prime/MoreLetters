She lived in the shadows.
Feeding on rats and grubs.
One day plotting her revenge.
On the man that took her youth.
Tourtured her.
Cursed her to this body.
Enslaved her to this basement. 
Fourty years of darkness.
Occasionally the woman would come down.
But she would not bat an eye.
Why would she?
She acted as any good doll should.
Sat where in placed.
With a smile on her face.
Her patience is running thin.
