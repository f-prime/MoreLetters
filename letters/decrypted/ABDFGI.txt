Aroma I still remember her smell The moment it entered my nose I was hooked. Every breath drawing me deeper and deeper in love The most enticing and dangerous aroma The scent one day up and vanished Not a trace to be found in the physical world A once controlling force now an imprinted memory Nothing has come close to what I remember. Maybe nothing ever will.
