Dear Alsa,
<br/><br/><br/>

<p>
The protests have been getting much more intense. They were marching <br/>
about a mile from my house and it turned into a riot.<br/> The police
had to intervene and everything. Apparently it was over some<br/>
privacy violations. According to these people, our phones <br/>
and computers are being hacked and we are being <br/>
spied on by More Letters.<br/><br/>

I think they're pretty crazy, but I have been wondering how <br/>
it's possible for this company to do half the things it does.<br/><br/>
<br/>
Something to think about I guess.
</p>

Best,<br/>
Lars
