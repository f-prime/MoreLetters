Dear Alsa,
<br/><br/><br/>

<p>
So, a weird thing happened to me on my walk today.<br/>
I was walking down the street and this crazing looking robot thing<br/>
zoomed past me. It looked like some kind of drone or something. <br/>
This thing must have been flying at like 150 MPH down the street. <br/><br/>

Apparently now they're starting to deliver letters with drones.<br/>
It's pretty impressive, but I don't know how I feel about it.<br/>
Apparently there have been incidents where they malfunction <br/>
and crash through people's windows. Have you see any around?
</p>

<br/><br/><br/><br/>
Best,<br/>
Lars
