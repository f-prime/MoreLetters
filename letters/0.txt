Dear Alsa,
<br/><br/><br/>

<p>
Hey there pen pal, long time no talk, huh? <br/>
When I heard that I can now send physical letters to anywhere <br/>
in the world in under an hour, I had to try it out. <br/><br/>
I also saw it as a good opportunity to connect with an old friend!<br/>
I hope you are well. <br/><br/>When you're back in the states let's meet up, eh?
</p>

<br/><br/><br/><br/>
Best,<br/>
Lars
