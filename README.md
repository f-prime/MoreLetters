# More Letters

An incremental crypto puzzle game.

## Setup

More Letters uses Vue.js

To start the site locally, you will need a local web server. If you open `index.html` directly you will get Cross Site Origin errors
due to the ES6 import syntax.

If you have Python3 installed a simple way to do this is to run `python3 -m http.server 8000` in the MoreLetters directory. Otherwise you will
need to configure a web server of your choosing.
