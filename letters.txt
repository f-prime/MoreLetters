- A new innovative postal service is started that changes the world of mailing letters
- Millions of people start using the service sending billions of letters
- People are very happy about the service and how fast it is
- People start to become accustom to the service and start to wish for more feature, faster speeds, etc
- The service fulfills these desires but goes to the extreme to fulfill it. Often infinging on people's privacy and safety to deliver mail faster and more efficiently

  simply think about a letter from a friend and it shows up in their mailbox.

# Letter 1

Dear Alsa,<br/>

<p>
I had to try out Postal Inc.<br/> 
I hear that they are really taking the \"snail\" out of \"snail mail\".<br/>
</p>
<p>
So, yeah, just wanted to say hi.
</p>
<p>
Hope all is well, isn't the weather great today?<br/>
See, I can say that now because you're going to get this in less than an hour!<br/> 
</p>

Best,<br/>

# Letter 2

Dear Alsa,

Wow, PI really blew up huh? I guess I can see why. I am starting to see their mail trucks all over the place.
It's like they never sleep. They seem happy though. I hear they are making really great money. 

I was checking their job listings today and they are hiring drivers. What do you think? I am tempted to apply... 
Couldn't hurt, and I could use the boost in pay.

Hope you are doing well.

Best,
Lars

# Letter 3

Dear Alsa,

So, a weird thing happened to me today. I was writing a letter to my brother this morning and I got a knock on the door.
It was the mailman. I thought it was a little bit weird that he come to the door, but I shrugged it off. 

There was something a bit off about him. He looked tired and sickly. Like he had been working non-stop for days. 

He had a letter in his hand addressed to me from my brother. When I opened it, it was the response to the letter that I was writing just before.

The letter that I didn't send yet. I don't know how that's possible... I was wondering if you had a similar experience.

Best,
Lars

# Letter 4

Alsa,

Shit. Did you hear about that kid from that was found dead the other night? They're saying that he was murdered.

Apparently he was one of those crazies that were boycotting PI. I can't help but think that maybe... 

No, maybe I am just paranoid. 

Hope you are holding up... let's get together soon, okay?

Lars

# Letter 5 (Encrypted)

Something isn't right, Alsa. It seems like more people are turning up dead every single day. All dying the same way.

This isn't a coincidence, something is very wrong. We are being watched, Alsa. I don't know what to do. 

I can't sleep, I can't eat, I just sit here afraid to go outside. I hear the drones more and more frequently now. 

We need to do something about this... I need your help...
