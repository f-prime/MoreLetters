Setting:

After a long war that has decimated a country, a powerful dictator has risen to power.
Those who oppose him and are caught are violently executed. Many people have tried to 
speak out and rebel against him, but all have failed. 

The Dictator's power stretched across every inch of the country. Everything is moniored,
from what people eat, to the conversations that they have, and most importantly the mail that they send.

Even as The Dictator's power grows, there are still those who seek to take him down. This is the story
of two of those people.

Dear Alsa,

We have changed the meeting time to 0015. I trust that you'll still be able to make it

- Lars
