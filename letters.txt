Arc

- A new innovative postal service is started that changes the world of mailing letters
- Millions of people start using the service sending billions of letters
- People are very happy about the service and how fast it is
- People start to become accustom to the service and start to wish for more feature, faster speeds, etc
- The service fulfills these desires but goes to the extreme to fulfill it. Often infinging on people's privacy and safety to deliver mail faster and more efficiently
- People start to become a bit weirded out. The service start doing things that would be impossible without some kind of privacy violation. Some are worried, others are still obvlious
- As the service improves, more and more people start to become away to what is going on. Letters are being received before they are physically sent, mailmen are acting strangely, people
  simply think about a letter from a friend and it shows up in their mailbox.
- A college student is found dead on the street. What looks like a bullet hole in his head makes it appear to be a gunshot wound.
- This is not an isolated incident. Other similar deaths have been reported around the world.
- Rumours start circulating that people within the postal service have been monitoring letters and getting rid of people who oppose it.
- Fearing that the postal system has become too powerful, the people start to boycott it.

# Letter 1

Dear Alsa,

I had to try out Postal Inc. I hear that they are really taking the "snail" out of "snail mail" and
keeping everything that made writing letters great! 

So, yeah, just wanted to say hi. Hope all is well, isn't the weather great today? 
See? I can say that now because you're going to get this in, like, an hour! Haha

So cool.

Best,
Lars 

# Letter 2

Dear Alsa,

Wow, PI really blew up huh? I guess I can see why. I am starting to see their mail trucks all over the place.
It's like they never sleep. They seem happy though. I hear they are making really great money. 

I was checking their job listings today and they are hiring drivers. What do you think? I am tempted to apply... 
Couldn't hurt, and I could use the boost in pay.

Hope you are doing well.

Best,
Lars

# Letter 3

Dear Alsa,

So, a weird thing happened to me today. I was writing a letter to my brother this morning and I got a knock on the door.
It was the mailman. I thought it was a little bit weird that he come to the door, but I shrugged it off. 

There was something a bit off about him. He looked tired and sickly. Like he had been working non-stop for days. 

He had a letter in his hand addressed to me from my brother. When I opened it, it was the response to the letter that I was writing just before.

The letter that I didn't send yet. I don't know how that's possible... I was wondering if you had a similar experience.

Best,
Lars

# Letter 4

Alsa,

Shit. Did you hear about that kid from that was found dead the other night? They're saying that he was murdered.

Apparently he was one of those crazies that were boycotting PI. I can't help but think that maybe... 

No, maybe I am just paranoid. 

Hope you are holding up... let's get together soon, okay?

Lars

# Letter 5 (Encrypted)

Something isn't right, Alsa. It seems like more people are turning up dead every single day. All dying the same way.

This isn't a coincidence, something is very wrong. We are being watched, Alsa. I don't know what to do. 

I can't sleep, I can't eat, I just sit here afraid to go outside. I hear the drones more and more frequently now. 

We need to do something about this... I need your help...
